# Plate Appearances and HRs: A Case Study

## Objective

Curiosity killed the cat. 

With this project, I wanted to learn a couple things:

  1. More first-hand experience wrangling, analyzing, and plotting data in the programming language client, R Studio after completing the Google/Coursera Data Analytics Professional Certificate
  2. What makes a hitter an above-average (or below-average) homerun hitter
  3. The difference (if any) in the rate of plate appearances (PA) and the occurance of a homerun (HR)
  4. Eventually, I want to build and evaluate a predictive model to predict how many PAs a player could hit before hitting a homerun. Obviously, the less is better. I feel like this could have practical applications -- for example in betting over/under the amount of homeruns in sports betting.

## Dataset
This project was sourced from 2018-2022 data from Baseball Reference. The dataset included all standard batting stats -- such as HR, games (G), PA, batting average (BA), on-base percentage (OBP), and slugging percentage (SLG) to name a few.

This dataset can be found here for 2018 and can be navigated for the following seasons: https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2018-standard-batting.shtml

## Technologies

The following technologies were used to build this project:
  - Language: R
  - Packages: readr, ggplot
